title: PDGs breakfast
draft: false
---

The MD Convention has traditionally featured a dinner for all attending PDGs and the current DGs, held on the night before the first day of the Convention. **This event is not covered by the Convention registration and is an additional cost for the attendees.**

The 2020 MDC Convention will however only span 2 days which does not leave an evening available for the PDGs dinner. There will instead be a PDGs breakfast, at the Riverside Hotel. This will be the hotel breakfast, but will be served in a private room. If you are staying at the Riverside Hotel, the cost of the breakfast is included in your acommodation fee. If you are not staying at the Riverside, a fee will be charged for the breakfast - details on the fee will be provided closer to the event.

Please indicate on your registration form if you will be attending the PDGs breakfast, or contact the Registration Secretary Kim van Wyk if you have already registered for the Convention and wish to attend the PDGs breakfast.
