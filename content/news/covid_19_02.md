Dear Fellow Lions,

We have just received confirmation that our International Guest PIP Kajit Habanananda has had to cancel his attendance at the MD410 Convention due to the travel bans relevant to the COVID-19 virus.

As communicated yesterday, we will keep you informed as to the way forward as soon as we have full clarity from all sources. 

On behalf of the MD410 Council, my thanks to the Convention Committee under the Chairmanship of Lion Trevor Hobbs, who are managing a crisis which we have never had to deal with previously and I please request you, Fellow Lions, to not bombard them with emails, etc.  I assure you that we will never put any of you in jeopardy.

Yours in Lionism, \
Jacqui Hocking \
Council Chairman \
Multiple District 410
